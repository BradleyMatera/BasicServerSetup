// This middleware is responsible for parsing the body of the request so that we can access it in req.body

// Using the imported router for all routes starting with '/api'
app.use('/api', router); // Prefix all routes with /api
// This tells the app to use the imported router for any route that starts with /api
// The router handles all the routes defined in the ./routes file
// This setup helps keep the code organized and separates the route handling logic from the main app file

module.exports = app; // Exporting the express app
// This exports the app object so it can be imported and used in other files, like server.js
